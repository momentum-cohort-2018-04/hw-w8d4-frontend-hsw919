# Firebase application

For this weekend's project, take a previous project and change it to use Firebase, using Firebase hosting and the realtime database. You can use other Firebase features as well.

## Suggested projects

* [Customer database](https://github.com/momentum-cohort-2018-04/hw-w4d1-frontend) - if you do this, you should add the ability to create and update customers.
* [Note-taking app](https://github.com/momentum-cohort-2018-04/hw-w4d3-frontend)
* [iTunes search](https://github.com/momentum-cohort-2018-04/hw-w4d4-frontend) - if you do this, save and display previous searches.
* [Freeshelf](https://github.com/momentum-cohort-2018-04/hw-w6d2-frontend) - the books should be in the Firebase database. Optimally, you would be able to edit and delete books from there.
* [Photo search](https://github.com/momentum-cohort-2018-04/hw-w6d3-frontend) - if you do this, users should be able to save a list of their favorite pictures. This will require Firebase authentication.

If you have a different idea for a project, just run it by Clinton first.
